  Hi, my name is Lee and I'm an electrical engineer currently on rotation with the Asset Performance Center here 
  at TVA. Over the past 17+ years, I've worked to incrementally modernize TVA's telecommunication system. From extending last 
  mile communications to rural areas of the valley, to organizing and automating network device information and configurations, I 
  have always been looking for ways to apply innovative tech solutions to really big workplace challenges. Working
  smarter to squeeze the best outcomes from every project is the name of the game I play.

  As you'll see below, an interest in using data and automation tools to tackle big problems has led me back to an 
  academic setting with the goal of formalizing my knowledge in the space of data analytics, machine learning, and, 
  in general, computer programming. As important as any concrete skill, the desire to be a continual learner has been 
  a central theme of my life. I firmly believe having sharp tools is important to doing great work. 

  I've continued this approach into my rotation where, as a Program Manager, Transmission Maintenance, I've used some of the 
  same tools, as well as some new ones, to ensure reliable transmission system operation and efficient utilization of resources. 

  The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Python</mark> <mark>PowerBI</mark> <mark>Linux</mark>
  <mark>eDNA</mark> <mark>Hitachi Lumada/APM</mark>

        title: APM Data Cleanup and Reporting
        sub_title: 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The Hitachi Lumada/APM software used by the APC integrates data from many sources at TVA. Inconsistencies in external data 
          have created large amounts of data cleanup inside Lumada. Tools like Microsoft PowerBI allow us to quickly pinpoint data
          problems so they can be resolved easily. 

          - Leveraged PowerBI to identify incorrect bushing data on transformers and breakers. 
          - Leveraged PowerBI to 

          PowerBI has also allowed the APC to offer custom reporting to device SMEs. 
          
          - Leveraged PowerBI to show historic trends of combustible gasses on 161KV Westing House Transformers, a very specific 
          report request that would be otherwise impossible to provide.
          - Leverage PowerBI to better understand my own monitoring responsibilities.

        sub_title: 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Lots of work has been dedicated to modifying TVA's SysAid ticketing system to include for support asset condition ticketing
          as well as normal network operations ticketing. A ticket reporting feature was added to Lumada assets to allow quick 
          ticketing summaries for any device.

          - Gained understanding of the SysAid API and PowerBI dataflows provided by other organizations, as well as Lumada limitations
          and workarounds.
          - Provided multiple approaches and solutions for integrating ticket data into Lumada. 

          Also served on a team to roll out asset condition ticketing to the TVA field organizations. This initiative is working to 
          gain buy-in and coordination between various TVA entities to ensure asset issues are communicated effectively and in such a 
          way that asset condition trends can be managed to ensure optimum operation and reliability of the TVA transmission system.

        title: CCVT Failure Inquiry
        sub_title: 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          CCVT failures have plagued TVA for years. As a very light exposure to the problem and the work involved to extract
          meaning from the current data, I completed a small and unofficial rotational assignment.

          - Gained a good understanding of TVA's <mark>eDNA</mark> data historian and the limitations of the contained data.
          - Gained exposure to the <mark>Avantis PRiSM</mark> tool as a method for analyzing data.

          While short, this was a great introductory look at TVA's data and available analytics systems.

        title: Modernizing Meter Communications
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Metering Services and Power Billing have always had a need for a stand-alone, low-cost networking solution for simple
          meter interrogation. A capable router equipped with a cellular interface turned out to be the perfect solution.

          - Lead engineer on the initial installation of nearly 1,000 3G cellular routers.
          - Designed and orchestrated the move of the devices from the public Internet to a private wireless solution.
          - Designed and orchestrated the move from 3G to 4G cellular.
          - Implemented and configured the vendor system for asset tracking and monitoring.
          - Acted as the liaison between TVA and the device manufacture to identify and diagnose issues, as well as integrate 
          and implement any required fix.
          - Implemented zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) system for 700 new 4G devices. The move to 4G coincided with much of the 
          network automation efforts within CCD&SP (see below), thus I was able to leverage my own <mark>Python</mark> expertise 
          to implement a ZTP system. This reduced per-device configuration and installation time from hours to minutes, saving TVA 
          huge amounts of time and energy.

        title: Network Automation and MongoDB
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Stemming from accomplishments of cleaning data in the CCD&SP IP address management system, the realization was
          made that more sophisticated tasks could be carried out using programmatic techniques.

          - Lead engineer on proof-of-concept, selection, and implementation of <mark>MongoDB</mark> as a fast and scalable database 
          for network device information.
          - Lead developer of solutions for programmatically querying, verifying, and recording device properties and configuration details.
          These capabilities have directly lead to authoritative knowledge of telecommunications system assets for quick and accurate reporting to 
          compliance agencies regarding various security inquiries.

        title: IP Address Management System Upgrade
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          TVA Transmission has always had a need to collect and organize large amounts of IP address information. From spreadsheets to
          Microsoft Access to BlueCat Proteus, suboptimal implementations of various solutions have been in place with the sole purpose
          of being an accurate information repository. The resulting data inaccuracies have led to countless hours of work discovering 
          and correcting addressing mistakes that could have easily been avoided.

          - Lead engineer on the transition to <mark>Infoblox DDI</mark>.
          - Included cleanup of vast amounts of data inaccuracies (~60% -> 95+% accuracy improvements) across nearly 8,000 networks containing
          18,000 devices and nearly 25,000 individual host IP addresses.
          - Developed a <mark>Python</mark> library that interfaced with the Infoblox API to automate the initial population of the new IPAM system.
          - Leveraged the library to streamline continuous data management and reporting, including a simplified <mark>Django</mark> powered web interface 
          for field personnel.

        title: LPC Interruptible Product (IP) and Flexibility Programs
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          TVA has offered IP products to provide customers with an opportunity to receive monthly credits on their power bill in 
          exchange for curtailing their power usage to a specified protected demand amount during times of TVA power system need. 
          Similarly, generation partners have been given the opportunity to generate up to 5% of their average electric needs from 
          distributed resources. Both customer solutions require communications paths between TVA and the LPC metering point. 

          - Technical lead and point of contact between all LPCs and TVA. 
          - Worked hand-in-hand with TVA partners to ensure smooth device turn up, as well as technical support for any configuration
          questions or issues.
          - Operated the Transmission Test Lab endpoint for proof of concept and documentation of new gateway devices in support of Central
          Operations.
          - Acted as a technical representative between customers and their device manufacturers.

          These were formative years, and form I did.


  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Alongside my interests in computer hardware and software, some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Cycling - I ride and race bikes in the woods. I've done over 100 mountain bike races with a few road races sprinkled in
      for good measure. I started riding a little over 10 years ago and have managed to clock about 55,000 miles. Doing these physically 
      challenging events has been an obsession and I think I'm a better person for it.
      - Woodworking - Realizing I won't be remembered for my amateur cycling achievements, I took up the hobby of woodworking to turn
      my free time into a tangible result. I find it to be the perfect intersection of art and engineering. I only make furniture for 
      myself and have completed several large pieces including a chest of drawers, five chairs, and a few tables.
      - Being the best daddy to an 8-year old little girl that I can be.
